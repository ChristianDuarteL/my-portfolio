                <p>Hi! I'm Christian Duarte, a software engineer from Mexico. I recently graduated from college but I've been working as a web developer at <a href="https://toronjalab.com">Toronja Lab</a> for a few years now, where I help with the development of a Laboratory Information System (LIS) as well as with many other projects.</p>
                <p>I've always loved maths and logical thinking, I've been programming for around 11 years now (just after I finished elementary school), I also got into electronics when I was in middle school and I do like it a lot, but I guess my passion for programming is much bigger. I love to learn new things and I'm always looking for new challenges to solve.</p>
